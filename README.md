# SDJSharp
Schedules Direct C# Library and Demo UI

This is a work in progress general C# library to access the schedulesdirect.org JSON interface from C#

Generally the first stage is to provide a route interface to each function and provide a fixed object response in a format that can be used directly with LINQ etc.

Afterwards, a second layer to provide higher level functions with those raw functions would be the next step.

Watch this space.
